Excel Dashboard Project: Starbucks Customer Analysis

This repository contains my Excel Data Analysis Project. I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle on Starbucks transactions and customer information. 

I standardized data formats, cleaned the data in Excel, and used nested IF statements along with Pivot tables and charts to create an interactive dashboard. The splicers I included on the left-hand side are filters that automatically change the charts based on the filters selected. 

I was curious about learning about the different types of Starbucks customers. 

I answered the following questions:
- What are the age ranges of Starbucks customers and how much money is spent per age range?
- When comparing the closest Starbucks to these customers, how much money is spent by nearest location?
- What is the income distribution of Starbucks customers?

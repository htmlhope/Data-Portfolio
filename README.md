Excel Dashboard Project: Starbucks Customer Analysis

This repository contains my Excel Data Analysis Project. I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle on Starbucks transactions and customer information. 

I standardized data formats, cleaned the data in Excel, and used nested IF statements along with Pivot tables and charts to create an interactive dashboard. The splicers I included on the left-hand side are filters that automatically change the charts based on the filters selected.

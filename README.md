Excel Dashboard Project: Starbucks Customer Analysis

For this Data Analysis project, I was curious about learning about the different types of Starbucks customers. The dataset is a Starbucks customer and transaction dataset downloaded from Kaggle.

Process:

I standardized data formats and cleaned the data in Excel. Next, I used nested IF statements along with Pivot tables and charts to create an interactive dashboard. The splicers I included on the left-hand side are filters that automatically change the charts based on the filters selected. 

I answered the following questions:
- What are the age ranges of Starbucks customers and how much money is spent per age range?
- When comparing the closest Starbucks to these customers, how much money is spent by nearest location?
- What is the income distribution of Starbucks customers?
  
The splicers on the left further drill down on customer occupation, Starbucks membership, and visit type.
